1. `td` elements of the `Rate` column should contain a `span` element with the `class` of `rate` wrapping three empty `span` elements.

1. `.rate` elements placed inside `.read` rows should have an additional class with the value of either `one`, `two`, or `three`, depending on the personal rate.

1. You should target the elements with the class of `read` and set their `background-image` to use a `linear-gradient` of your choice.

1. You should target the elements with the class of `to-read` and `in-progress` class and set their `background-image` to use a `linear-gradient` of your choice.

1. You should set the `display` property of each `span` element to `inline-block`.

1. You should target `.to-read` descendants with the class of `status` and set their `border` and `background-image` properties.

1. You should target the first two descendants of `.two` elements and set their `background-image` property to use a `linear-gradient`.

1. You should target the three descendants of `.three` elements and set their `background-image` property to use a `linear-gradient`.
